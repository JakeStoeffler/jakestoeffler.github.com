    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to my first ever blog post!  Chances are that you know who I am if you&#8217;re reading this.  You&#8217;re probably a friend, co-worker, or family member.  If you don&#8217;t know me, that&#8217;s cool too!  You probably stumbled your way here via one of my profiles on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/JakeStoeffler">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JakeStoeffler">GitHub</a>, or <a href="http://stackexchange.com/users/1165812/jake-stoeffler?tab=accounts">Stack Exchange</a>.  If you knew me, you would know that I don&#8217;t especially like talking about myself.  But since is my blog, I guess I&#8217;ll just have to get used to it.  So <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSLlZh9yelk">here we go</a>.</p>

<h3>About me</h3>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t noticed yet, I&#8217;m a bit of a geek.  I&#8217;ve chosen to embrace that fact rather than fight it.  After all, it&#8217;s part of who I am, and as Dr. Seuss (<a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Dr._Seuss#Misattributed">may or may not have</a>) put it,</p>

<blockquote><p>Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don&#8217;t matter and those who matter don&#8217;t mind.</p></blockquote>

<p>It all started for me when I was seven years old.  I vividly remember walking into the living room on Christmas morning to see what Santa had brought.  A Quantex PC with an Intel Pentium III, 6 GB hard drive, and 128 MB of RAM?!?!  It looked just like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scob89/3226641369/sizes/l/in/photostream/">this</a>, except of course without the DVD drives.  It purred like a kitten on Windows 95.  I was blown away.  I simply couldn&#8217;t handle the power of Netscape Navigator over a blazing 28.8 kbit/sec dial-up connection.  (Yes, Netscape.  Remember how awesome it was?  I must confess, I never was much of an IE guy.)</p>

<p>In first grade I found myself bored with school because I had already learned how to read at home with PC games like <a href="http://www.virtualapple.org/mecc-a153.html">Word Munchers</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Knowledge-Adventure-Reading-Blaster-Ages/dp/B000WS5PUK/ref=pd_cp_sw_1">Reading Blaster</a>.  So in my spare time, I built my first website, with a little help from Microsoft Frontpage and <a href="http://tripod.com">Tripod.com</a>.  (I&#8217;ve <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19991009000826/http://www.tripod.com/">tried to dig up</a> my Tripod site from back in the day, but haven&#8217;t had any luck.)</p>

<p>From there I just kept learning more and more, teaching myself for the most part.  I like to think it&#8217;s because I have a natural tendency to want to figure things out and understand how they really work.</p>

<p>By eighth grade I had learned the basics of HTML and PHP, and I built a phpBB forum that my friends and I used to communicate during English class when we were &#8220;typing papers.&#8221;  I ended up getting my internet privileges revoked because I used a proxy to get through the school&#8217;s firewall.</p>

<p>When I reached high school I was fortunate enough to take some computer science classes and earn college credit.  MIT was my dream school, but I was deferred and eventually rejected by them, so I decided to attend the <a href="http://wisc.edu">University of Wisconsin</a>, which is close to <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/NOGDu">home</a> but also <a href="http://www.news.wisc.edu/20966">a great school</a>.  I&#8217;m actually glad things happened that way.  I&#8217;m now in my third year of studying Computer Science with a minor in Math.  I&#8217;ve had a couple of great <a href="http://JakeStoeffler.github.com/resume">internship experiences</a> so far with <a href="http://www.avid.com/US/">Avid</a> and <a href="http://www-142.ibm.com/software/products/us/en/category/BPM-SOFTWARE">IBM</a>, and I hope to have another one in before I graduate one year from this December.</p>

<p>Okay, enough nerdy stories.</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>Why am I starting this blog?  Well, I&#8217;m definitely not expecting this to go viral any time soon.  It would be cool if it did, but that&#8217;s not at all the point.  At the moment, my goals for this are as follows.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Exercise</strong> my passion for technology.  Continue to learn more.  Keep myself (and hopefully those who read this blog) informed about the latest technologies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sharpen</strong> my technical communication skills, which are vital to success as a software engineer and really anyone these days.  I&#8217;m not yet where I&#8217;d like to be in this area, but I know I can get there with some practice.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chronicle</strong> what I learn and what I&#8217;m able to accomplish as I go down this career path.  Maybe one day I&#8217;ll look back at this and see how young and naive I was.  Maybe I&#8217;ll just laugh.  Time will tell.</p></li>
</ol>


<h3>That&#8217;s it</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;ve made it this far, I want to thank you for reading my first blog post!  Come back for more soon!  I hope that whatever you may find on my blog is helpful or interesting in one way or another.
