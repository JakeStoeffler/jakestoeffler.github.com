Hi there. My name is Jake Stoeffler.  I’m a software developer studying [Computer Science](http://cs.wisc.edu) at the [University of Wisconsin - Madison](http://wisc.edu).  In my free time I enjoy playing guitar, [discovering new music](http://songza.com/user/stoefflerj), [running](http://www.runtastic.com/en/users/Jake-Stoeffler), and spending time outdoors.

This is my personal website where I'll eventually have a blog and an exhibit of the various software projects I’ve worked on.  Needless to say, it’s a work in progress at the moment, but check back soon!
